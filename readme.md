###  Project Abstract 

**Title:** Quantum State Tomography with Spiking Neural Networks

This project explores the application of **neuromorphic computing** to quantum information processing. Specifically, it utilizes a **Spiking Neural Network (SNN)** model to efficiently and accurately perform **Quantum State Tomography (QST)** the process of reconstructing an unknown quantum state using a series of measurements.

The research aims to demonstrate that **SNNs**, characterized by their energy efficiency and biologically inspired dynamics, offer a viable and potentially superior alternative to conventional machine learning approaches for complex quantum measurement problems. This work directly contributes to the emerging field of **neural quantum interfaces**, paving the way for applications in **quantum control**, **real-time quantum feedback loops**, and advanced **hybrid quantum-classical computing** architectures where fast, low-power processing of quantum data is critical.
